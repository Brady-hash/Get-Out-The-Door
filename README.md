# Get-Out-The-Door
A web application to help kids get ready in the morning.

## Description
This web application helps families organize their morning routines, by keeping the kids engaged and on task. We use an analog clock to help the kids keep track of time as they complete their tasks. As they complete tasks, they earn points they can redeem and reference toys from Target on a second page.

## Getting Started
Open the URL (URL), the application runs within the browser. 
First you will be prompted to enter each child's name.
Once all children's names have been entered, you can proceed to:
- add tasks, and assign them to all or some of the children.
- enter your city to get a current weather report.
- enter the time you need to 'Get Out The Door' by and the clock will change colors as the target time approaches.
- check off task items as they are completed, resulting in points for each kid being saved to redeem on the rewards page.
